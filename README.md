DisplayPlacer Script for Mirror and extended display

Description

This script automates the process of configuring display settings for macOS devices using displayplacer. It performs the following steps:

1. **Checks System Architecture**: Determines whether the device is using Apple silicon (arm64) or Intel architecture.
2. **Downloads and Installs displayplacer**: Fetches the appropriate version of displayplacer based on the system architecture if it is not already installed.
3. **Identifies Display IDs**: Searches for the persistent IDs of the built-in and external displays connected to the device.
4. **Configures Display Settings**: Allows the user to set variables for resolution, refresh rate (Hz), color depth, and scaling. It then constructs and executes a command to mirror the built-in and external displays with the specified settings, optimizing for the external display.

Usage

To use this script, set the following variables before running it:

- `RESOLUTION`: Desired resolution for the displays.
- `HZ`: Refresh rate for the displays.
- `COLOR_DEPTH`: Color depth for the displays.
- `SCALING`: Scaling factor for the displays.

You can deploy this script via Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to automate the configuration process across multiple macOS devices.
